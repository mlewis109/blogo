Welcome to Blogo's manual!
==========================

Blogo adds abilities of the programming language `Logo <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)>`_ 
to `Blender's <https://www.blender.org/>`_ python scripting.
It allows the creation of simple 3D models with very little knowledge of how Blender actually works 
and without having to use a mouse to manipulate objects in space.
